    <h1>Assignment Zero: Set up and Frameworks</h1>
    <p>For this assignment, we had to chose what framework we wanted to use for the rest of the semester. Initially, I went with Three.JS but I was having difficulties with working camera and coordinates so I switched to Unity. In order to achieve this assignment, I used my game object's transform properties for postion and rotation to move them at a certain speed using time.</p>
